## ❖ Tech & Roadmap

Yumeta began with a solid foundation of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, crafting a clean and responsive interface.

Looking forward, the platform will evolve with immersive and interactive features:

- **Dynamic Anime & Manga Selector:**  
  Instead of simple dropdowns, users will engage with an interactive character-selection panel reminiscent of fighting games.  
  Selecting a character or category will illuminate that side with smooth animations, while the other dims subtly—creating an intuitive and visually captivating navigation experience.  
  This will lead to rich experiences like synchronized anime streaming and shared manga reading.

- **Custom-built AI Chat Companions:**  
  Developing an in-house AI conversational system based on lightweight machine learning techniques, aiming for natural and heartfelt interactions without relying on large external LLM services.

- **Global & Themed Chat Rooms:**  
  Real-time spaces where fans gather, share, and celebrate their passion together.

- **Rewards, Games & Exclusive Content:**  
  Engage with the platform to earn Yumeta Coins, unlocking special content, mini-games, and unique experiences designed to deepen your connection to the community.
